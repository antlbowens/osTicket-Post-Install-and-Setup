# osTicket Post Install and Setup
This project demonstrates how I deployed and configured the open-source osTicket help desk ticketing system on a Windows 11 virtual machine hosted in Microsoft Azure.
The goal of this lab was to practice configuring key administrative components within osTicket — including Roles, Departments, Teams, Agents, Users, SLAs, and Help Topics — to simulate a functional IT support environment.
This lab builds upon my previous osTicket Setup repository and continues the process of creating a complete end-to-end help desk system deployment.
